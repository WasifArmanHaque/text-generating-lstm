# PROJECT TITLE

Recurrent Neural Network writes Sherlock

# Overview

In this simple project, I used [Keras](www.keras.io) Deep Learning framework for training an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) - a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks, on a portion of the famous Arthur Conan Doyle novel 'Hound of the Baskerville'. 
The `generate_sherlock_word.py` script loads the data, trains an LSTM model on it and displays generated text at each training step. It takes at least 20 iterations for the generated text to appear somewhat coherent.
The text data used is taken from [here](https://sherlock-holm.es/stories/plain-text/houn.txt).
